This PhD would not have been possible without:

\begin{itemize}[label={}]
\item the excellent guidance and supervision of Clemens Kaminski;

\item the enthusiasm, dedication, and help of all the members of the LAG group;

\item the biological and computational advice from members of the MNG and QI group, and particularly Miranda Robbins for her friendship;

\item the incredible work of my collaborators, especially Michelle Teplensky and Edward Avezov;

\item the support of my parents and family;

\item and all the friends who have looked after me during the last 3 years, particularly Helene Mobbs and Ellie Chan, members of the St. Catharine's College choir, and the top floor crew.
\end{itemize}

For these groups and individuals I am extremely thankful.
