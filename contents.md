## Chapter 1: Introduction
This thesis aims to fulfil a number of purposes
* A practical guide to obtaining good images from a microscope, and presenting this data to the community
* A detailed account of work I've completed over the past three years, including novel work published and presented in internationally renowned research journals and conferences.
* A document of evidence that I have made a 'significant contribution to knowledge', and have attained the appropriate level of expertise to earn the PhD.

## Part I: Hardware and Software

## Chapter 2: Structured Illumination Microscopy
* Quick introduction to the technique
* Our hardware setup
  * Pockels Cell insatllation
  * Imaging at 11Hz
  * Multi-colour (with the Optosplit)
  * 90nm resolution
  * Graphs, calibration?
  * Nice control software to do all of this!
* Reconstruction
  * Introduction, and short mention of other tools that are available
  * LAG-SIM, and ImageJ plugin
  * Setting reconstruction parameters
* SIM SHOWCASE!

## Chapter 3: FPBioimage: A web-based tool for 3D image visualisation
* Bit of background on rendering, webGL, etc.
* Major project!
* Online visualisation: WebGL, HTML, Javascript, Unity, C#
* Quick preparation and uploading to AWS: Java, Icy, FIJI/ImageJ
* Integeration with other software tools: OMERO
* Virtual relaity on mobile phones: also very cool/useful for conferences
Publications: Nature Photonics (2017), _Biophysical Journal (2018?)_
* FPBioimage Showcase!

# Part II: Biological Applications

## Chapter 4: Using Metal Organic Frameworks for Drug Delivery
* Drug into MOF, MOF into cell
* SiRNA for multicolour without crosstalk
* SIM in 3D
* Colocalisation analysis
Publication: JACS (2017), _maybe Nature Materials (2018)_

## Chapter 5: ER Network Dynamics
* Directed movement in ER goes against previous model
* Flow modelled and shown to be ATP-dependent
* High-speed SIM to observe pinching and network rearrangement
  * Machine learning with Trainable WEKA Segmentation
  * MATLAB script for network analysis
* And all the rest of it..!
Publication: _Nature cell biology (2018?)_

## Chapter 6: Conclusion
* Pull everything together, with a nice example of publishing a 3D dataset:
1. Fast SIM capabilities
2. Nice clicky SIM user-interface
3. Quick reconstruction
4. Publish online with FPBioimage
5. Publish any large associated datasets with FPData
  * Analysis completed with any number of the analysis tools I've created, or some new ones

## Chapter 7: Future research opportunities
